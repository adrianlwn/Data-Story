        In past, the main source of information for people was their local newspaper,
        their radio or television newscast or even natural conversation.
        Information could take days to propagate in the whole world and then only few
        topics where selected and broadcasted by journalists. Because of that the awareness
        of people to world events was very limited, and it was virtually impossible to quantify
        or qualify the level of reaction to a specific event.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Since then, we have seen the rise of Internet and Social Medias. The world has become so
        connected that people can virtually be aware of everything happening on the planet at any moment.
        As there is no limits to the availability of information anymore, one could think that people's
        awareness would have expanded. But it seems that people still feel only touched by events
        that are physically close or events that touch people who are socially or culturally close.
        The <strong> awareness or reaction level</strong> in some sense would be linked to the empathy a country could have for another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question :</strong> Can we predict awareness to specific events in
        different countries around the globe ? Can we model the awareness and predict reaction on social media using cultural and proximity metrics between countries?

      <h2>Estimating awareness through hashtags</h2>

      <p align="justify">
        Over the past few years Twitter has become a plateform where people all over
        the world express themselves. Hashtags are prevalent on Twitter and have become
        more and more common place in various social networks over the past few years.
        When referring to major events there are always specific Hashtags
        which pop up in a multitude of languages and with various spellings therefore
        demonstrating that there are people from various origins which react to a given event.
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" >
          <img src = "../img/Nigeria_2016_hashtags.png" style="max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
      </div>


      <p align="justify">
        By using Twitter the idea was to try to observe global trends regarding events
         which objectively should generate similar levels of reactions worldwide. But
         how can we define similar events? How can we choose events so that they may
         be objectively comparable? </br></br>

         Choosing events similar in nature is already a good start towards selecting events.
         It is also important that the impact of the selected event on the population
         generate sufficient reactions both in-house with the potential of generating
         reactions world-wide. We then need to ask ourselves in recent times what has
         generated the biggest buzz?  </br></br>

         More often than not people react to events which
         have an impact on people's lives, on their safety which is why terrorist
         related events are interesting for our study. One would imagine that the more
         people are injured, the higher the reaction. Therefore, in order to ensure
         that we have enough tweets we selected events in different countries which
         had a large number of civilian casualties. For comparison's sake, we also
        selected a number of events of different magnitude around a different time
        period.  </br></br>
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" >
          <img src = "../img/events_img.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
      </div>

      <p align="justify">
         To account for the fluctuation of activity on twitter over the different years
         the events were selected to be in the same overall timeframe. The tweets were
         then acquired using relevant hashtags for an entire week following the event.

      <h2>Geolocating Tweets And Measuring Reactions</h2>


      <p align="justify">
         Selecting events and scaping the tweets may have been a challenge, but one
         of the biggest ones to face was that of actually determining where the tweets
         came from. Besides the fact that locations are not always provided, the locations
         are input manually. Anybody is free to put anything they want and that
         often leads to locations which are completely absurd!
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" id = "funny_hashtags">
          <img src = "../img/Hashtags__locations_transparent.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy" alt="Examples of Absurd Locations Provided">
      </div>


      <p align="justify">
         That is why it was important to create a robust mapping which would be able to
         correctly map the largest number of locations possible. To do so we relied on
         three levels of mapping.
               </p>
         <ol>
         <li align="justify">A first level where we map the country names and capitals in different languages and with multiple spellings to the ISO2 country code </li>
         <li align="justify">A second level where we map the top 20'000 cities in the world names and capitals to the ISO2 country code</li>
         <li align="justify">A final level where we take the GEONAMES database to map all the cities in
            the world to their respective countries. The importance of this mapping lies in the fact that cities with the same names
            are selected based on population. Therefore given a city, the output will be the country corresponding to the city with
            the largest population.
           </li>
         </ol>

      </div>

      <div class="row">
      <p align="justify">
      So how does this mapping work? Once each of the cities with the different name
      variants were linked to their respective country the important steps towards
      identifying the location are illustrated as follows.
    </p>

    <div class="image_tweets" >
        <img src = "../img/geolocalisation.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
    </div>

    <p align="justify">
    So, how many tweets were we actually able to geolocate overall? Considering only those for which
    we initially had a location and inspite all the absurdities found, we were able to gather quite
    a few tweets per event but as we will quickly realise, there are inequalities in reactions between
    the different events.
  </p>


  <p align="justify">
  Regardless of the discrepancies in reactions, looking at the events in Nigeria we can see that the
  reaction increases with the amplitude of the event. The massacre which lead to over 200 deaths generated
  almost 10 times more tweets than the shooting which happend a year later. But this depends largely on the
    event. As we can see, Charlie Hebdo is the perfect example of an extreme reaction to an event with an objectively
    small number of minor casualties.

</p>


    <div class="image_tweets" >
        <img src = "../img/event_reactions.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
    </div>

    <p align="justify">

    Regardless, we see that in most cases the locations are given around 50% of the time by
    the country name or capital. The only time where that is not the case is
    for the event in the United States. This probably stems from the fact that Americans
    most probably relate to their state or town than people in other countries around the world.
    Another interesting thing we can see is that there are very few tweets with locations
    which are not geolocated in the end. A few examples of those were provided in the
    word cloud above.
