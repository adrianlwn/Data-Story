        In past, the main source of information for people was their local newspaper,
        their radio or television newscast or even natural conversation.
        Information could take days to propagate in the whole world and then only few
        topics where selected and broadcasted by journalists. Because of that the awareness
        of people to world events was very limited, and it was virtually impossible to quantify
        or qualify the level of reaction to a specific event.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Since then, we have seen the rise of Internet and Social Medias. The world has become so
        connected that people can virtually be aware of everything happening on the planet at any moment.
        As there is no limits to the availability of information anymore, one could think that people's
        awareness would have expanded. But it seems that people still feel only touched by events
        that are physically close or events that touch people who are socially or culturally close.
        The <strong> awareness or reaction level</strong> in some sense would be linked to the empathy a country could have for another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we predict awareness to specific events in
        different countries around the globe ? Can we model the awareness and predict reaction on social media using cultural and proximity metrics between countries?

      <h2>Estimating reactions and awareness through hashtags</h2>

      <p align="justify">
        Over the past few years Twitter has become a plateform where people all over
        the world express themselves. Hashtags are prevalent on Twitter and have become
        more and more common place in various social networks over the past few years.
        When referring to major events there are always specific Hashtags
        which pop up in a multitude of languages and with various spellings therefore
        demonstrating that there are people from various origins which react to a given event.
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" >
          <img src = "../img/Nigeria_2016_hashtags.png" style="max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
      </div>


      <p align="justify">
        By using Twitter the idea was to try to observe global trends regarding events
         which objectively should generate similar levels of reactions worldwide. But
         how can we define similar events? How can we choose events so that they may
         be objectively comparable? </br></br>

         Choosing events similar in nature is already a good start towards selecting events.
         It is also important that the impact of the selected event on the population
         generate sufficient reactions both in-house with the potential of generating
         reactions world-wide. We then need to ask ourselves in recent times what has
         generated the biggest buzz?  </br></br>

         More often than not people react to events which
         have an impact on people's lives, on their safety which is why terrorist
         related events are interesting for our study. One would imagine that the more
         people are injured, the higher the reaction. Therefore, in order to ensure
         that we have enough tweets we selected events in different countries which
         had a large number of civilian casualties. For comparison's sake, we also
        selected a number of events of different magnitude around a different time
        period.  </br>
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" >
          <img src = "../img/events_img.png" style="max-width:60%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
      </div>

      <p align="justify">
         </br>To account for the fluctuation of activity on twitter over the different years
         the events were selected to be in the same overall timeframe. The tweets were
         then acquired using relevant hashtags for an entire week following the event.

      <h2>Geolocating Tweets And Measuring Reactions</h2>


      <p align="justify">
         Selecting events and scaping the tweets may have been a challenge, but one
         of the biggest ones to face was that of actually determining where the tweets
         came from. Besides the fact that locations are not always provided, the locations
         are input manually. Anybody is free to put anything they want and that
         often leads to locations which are completely absurd!
      </p>

      <div class="image_tweets" id = "funny_hashtags">
          <img src = "../img/Hashtags__locations_transparent.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy" alt="Examples of Absurd Locations Provided">
      </div>


      <p align="justify">
         That is why it was important to create a robust mapping which would be able to
         correctly map the largest number of locations possible. To do so we relied on
         three levels of mapping.
               </p>
         <ol>
         <li align="justify">A first level where we map the country names and capitals in different languages and with multiple spellings to the ISO2 country code </li>
         <li align="justify">A second level where we map the top 20'000 cities in the world names and capitals to the ISO2 country code</li>
         <li align="justify">A final level where we take the GEONAMES database to map all the cities in
            the world to their respective countries. The importance of this mapping lies in the fact that cities with the same names
            are selected based on population. Therefore given a city, the output will be the country corresponding to the city with
            the largest population.
           </li>
         </ol>

      </div>

      <div class="row">
      <p align="justify">
      So how does this mapping work? Once each of the cities with the different name
      variants were linked to their respective country the important steps towards
      identifying the location are illustrated as follows.
    </p>

    <div class="image_tweets" >
        <img src = "../img/geolocalisation.png" style="max-width:90%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
    </div>

    <p align="justify">
    In the end, how many tweets were we actually able to geolocate overall? Considering only those for which
    we initially had a location and inspite all the absurdities found, we were able to gather quite
    a few tweets per event but as we will quickly realize, there are inequalities in reactions between
    the different events.
    </p>


      <div class="image_tweets" >
          <img src = "../img/event_reactions.png" style="max-width:60%;width:auto;height:auto;" align="center" id = "hasthags_birdy">
      </div>


  <p align="justify">
    </br>
    We see that in most cases the locations are given around 50% of the time by
    the country name or capital. The only time where that is not the case is
    for the event in the United States. This most likely stems from the fact that Americans
    most probably relate to their state or town than people in other countries around the world.
    Another interesting thing we can see is that there are very few tweets with locations
    which are not geolocated in the end. A few examples of those were provided in the
    word cloud above. </br> </br>

  <h4>Visualizing Reactions To Different Events </h4>

  <p align="justify">
    </br>
    In the following map we can visualize the number of tweets containing hashtags related
    to specific events. The events are given by the red circles. Cliking on one will load
    the corresponding map. The map can display either the raw number of tweets or the
    relative reaction obtained through normalization by the estimated baseline twitter
    activity.

      <h4>Strong unbalance in Reactions </h4>


      <p align="justify">
        </br>
        Looking at the reactions themselves, for the events in Nigeria we can see that the
        reaction increases with the amplitude of the event. The massacre which lead to over 200 deaths generated
        almost 10 times more tweets than the shooting which happend a year later. But this depends largely on the
        event. As we can see, Charlie Hebdo is the perfect example of an extreme reaction to an event with an objectively
        small number of casualties. </br> </br>

        We can visualize this by using the same scale for all events. This highlights the imbalance
        of reactions between the different events.

   <section id = "Modelling Awareness">
     <div class="row">
       <h2> Modelling the Reactions</h2>

       <p align="justify">
         </br>
         How can we predict reactions? People often react to events that happen closeby.
         Given the visualization of the reactions it does not seem as though distance metrics on
         their own would suffice. That is why cultural metrics are also important to take into
         account.Therefore, can a combination of cultural and proximity metrics be used as predictors?
         Can we create a model which, given the country where an event occurs, would be able to predict the reactions
         worldwide with respect to the baseline twitter activity?

       </p>

       <h3> General Metrics </h3>

       <p align="justify">
         Countries can be characterized by general attributes such as population, size, gross
         domestic product (GDP), poverty line, internet users and so forth. These metrics
         are interesting because they are in direct link to the number of tweets in a conutry
         and can be used as normalizing factors.

       </p>

       <h3> Distance Metrics </h3>

       <p align="justify">
         As we mentioned previously, distance tends to play an important role in
         determining people's interest regarding a specific event. But there are several
         types of distances which can be considered when speaking of countries. The first
         and most evident is the <strong> birds-eye-view distance </strong> between the countries. This
         can be computed based on the positions of the center of each country. But this
         is not enough. Take for example the US and Canada, the distance between the
         center of thees two countries is much larger than the distance between France and
         any of its neighboring countries.

         </br>
         So what else could we consider to have a more representative representation
         of distance between the different countries? We came up with three other distance
         metrics which combined would be more complete.


       </br></br>
         <strong> Relative Importance of Neighbors</strong> </br>
         To take into account the fact that two countries can be neighbors and still
         have a big distance between them we decided to create a metric which would give
         importance to countries which are direct neighbors. We also wanted to make sure
         to give each neighbor the importance it is due. For example France has
         multiple countries at its border. But that does not mean that each of these
         countries are of similar importance. That is why we weighted this metric by
         the size of the countries. Therefore a small neighboring country such as Luxemburg
         would have a smaller weight than Germany for example.


       </br></br>
         <strong>Hop Distance</strong> </br>
         This second metric accounts not only for direct neighbors but also for the
         smallest number of countries which would need to be traversed to connect any
         two countries in the world.




         </br></br>
         <strong>Flight Routes</strong>  </br>
         This last metric accounts for movement of populations between the different
         countries. The assumption is that the existence of flight routes is due to
         the fact that people exhibit a certain interest for the other country. The more
         often you visit a place, the more likely you are to be interested in what is
         going on there.


       </p>


       </br>

       <h3> Cultural Metrics </h3>

       <p align="justify">

         People tend to feel close to people they can relate to, people who share similar
         values. One would therefore assume that people are interested in events that
         occur in areas where there are people that are culturally close to you. But how
         can you quantify cultural proximity?

         </br></br>
         <strong>Languages</strong></br>
         Languages are representative of culture and most of the time, countries which
         speak the same language have a given proximity. However speaking or not speaking
         the same language is not sufficient to quantify proximity. Many languages are
         similar in the sense of understanding the other language, learning it, etc.
         That why we used phylogenetic trees to approximate Linguistic distances between
         the different languages and compute a linguistic distance between the different countries.

         </br></br>
         <strong>Religions</strong></br>
         Religion relate to people's mentalities and affects the way people think.
         Religion can create bonds between different populations and countries and therefore
         have an impact on the awareness to events that happen in countries with the
         similar religious backgrounds.

       <h2> Creating the Graph and Using Diffusion to Predict Reactions</h2>

       <p align="justify">
       Given all of these metrics we created a graph linking all countries. The more
       countries have attributes in common, the more likely they are to react to what
       is going on. But how do we quantify that two countries share things in common?
       Our original idea was to use what we see in recommender systems and topic detection
       to find amongst all our features the ones which best link the countries together.

     <h2>Critical Assessment</h2>

     <p align="justify">

     Twitter is inherently biased because it is a social media plateform. This
     implies that people are not necessarily subscribed or that they are active on
     network. In general social media is relatively new and tends to attract
     younger generations which are generally less aware about what is going on not
     only around the world but even in their immediate environment.</br></br>

     When people tweet they do not necessarily provide their location and this may also
     be cultural. Depending on the countries, people are more or less aware of the
     dangers of providing their locations on social media and therefore more or less
     inclined to provide personal information in general. This was partially corrected
     by using a normalizing factor with the tweets but is still an inherent bias in
     the original dataset.</br></br>


     The absence of reaction to an event on social media does not necessarily imply that
     people are not interested in what is going on. We assume that the proportion of people
    who react to an event is always the same with respect to the overall number of tweeters</br></br>


     Not having standardized locations required creating a mapping which in itself
     is imperfect. </br></br>

       For all of these reasons it was evident that creating a metric would be challenging.
