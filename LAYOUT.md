# Layout of the Data Story :
## Origin Story :
In past, the main source of information for people was their local news-paper, their radio or television newscast or natural conversation. Information could take days to propagate in the whole world and then only few topics where selected and broadcasted by journalists. (Also it was virtually impossible to quantify or qualify the level of reaction to a specific event). Because of that the awareness of people to world events was very limited.

Since then, we have seen the rise of Internet and Social Medias. The world has become so connected that people can virtually be aware of everything happening on the planet at any moment. As there is no limits to the availability of information anymore, one could think that people's awareness would have increased. 

The filtering of the information is done socially and culturally.
Today's phenomena can be linked to the level of empathy a country could feel for another one. Those awareness/empathy could be explained by several factors :
-  The cultural proximity :
  - Language
  - Real Distance
  - Neighborhood
  - Level of wealth (GDP, ...)
- The flows of population :
  - Immigrants feeling linked to their origin country
- The scarcity of the events :
  - A country that is frequently touched by dramatic events would get less attention than a country that is struck for the first time.  

In order to measure this level of awareness we could study all the
- Social Media study :
  - **Twitter** : Number and of tweets related to a specific event in the week following an event.
  - **Facebook**
  - Others : Weibo, Pinterest, Internet Forums , ...
- Newspaper and Television

Is the cultural differences still a factor

## Main Steps :
- Introduction
- Measurement of Awareness of specific cases :
  - Explaining and Displaying Case 1 :
  - Explaining and Displaying Case 2 : contradictions
- Modeling of Awareness :
  - Display every Metric on the same map
- Comparison between the Measure and the Model :
  - Correlation
  - Regression
- Conclusion about the relevance and limits of the Metric Modeling and the Measurement
