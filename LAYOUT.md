# Layout of the Data Story :

## Main Steps :
- Introduction :
- **Measurement** of Awareness of specific cases :
  - Explaining and Displaying *Case 1* : comparable events and reaction level
  - Explaining and Displaying *Case 2* : contradictions in the reaction level
- **Modeling** of Awareness :
  - Display every Metric on the same map (layers)
    - Clicking on a country would display the closest countries in a choropleth (JS : D3 DataMaps)
  - Comparison between the Measure and the Model :
    - Correlation
    - Regression
    - ...
  - Display the Global Cultural Proximity metric (created using the best features)
    - For every country or only the ones of the *cases*
- Conclusion about the relevance and limits of the Metric Modeling and the Measurement

## Story :

### Introduction
In past, the main source of information for people was their local newspaper, their radio or television newscast or even natural conversation. Information could take days to propagate in the whole world and then only few topics where selected and broadcasted by journalists. Because of that the awareness of people to world events was very limited, and it was virtually impossible to quantify or qualify the level of reaction to a specific event.

Since then, we have seen the rise of Internet and Social Medias. The world has become so connected that people can virtually be aware of everything happening on the planet at any moment. As there is no limits to the availability of information anymore, one could think that people's awareness would have expanded. But it seems that people still feel only touched by events that are physically close or the ones where the victims are socially or culturally close. The **awareness level** might be linked to the empathy a country could have for another one.

**Question** : What is the world population awareness level to specific events happening around the globe ? Is this level linked to any cultural proximity or simply the distance ?

### Possible Methods :


In order to **measure** this level of awareness we could study :
- Social Media  :
  - Twitter : Tweets are a good way to measure the
  - Others : Facebook, Weibo, Internet Forums , ...
- Newspaper, Television or other Traditional Medias
- Make Polls about the subject

Those empathy levels could be **quantified** by several factors :
- Physical distance
- The cultural proximity between countries :
  - Language
  - Religious beliefs
  - Level of wealth (GDP, ...)
  - The flows of population (Immigrants feeling linked to their origin country)
- The nature of the events :
  - Large number of casualties
  - Type of the event (Terrorist Attack, )
  - The scarcity of the event (a country that is frequently touched by dramatic events would get less attention than a country that is struck for the first time)

### Selected Method :

[...]

Number and of tweets related to a specific event in the week following an event
